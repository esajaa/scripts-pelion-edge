# creating an upgrade tarball

The createUpgrade.sh script can be used to create a field upgrade tarball.

```
> sudo createupGrade.sh <old-wic> <new-wic> <upgrade_certificate> <upgrade_key> [upgrade-tag]
```
old_wic_file        - base image for upgrade
new_wic_file        - result image for upgrade
upgrade_certificate - certificate packaged with upgrade used to verify signatures
upgrade_key         - private key for upgrade_certificate used to generate signatures
upgrade_tag         - optional text string prepended to output tarball filename


Notes:
  1. createUpgrade must be run as root as it calls functions such as mount and rsync which require root access
  2. old-wic and new-wic are the *.wic images produced by yocto build
  3. output is < upgrade-tag >-field-upgradeupdate.tar.gz
  4. createUpgrade mounts the partitions from the wic files on loopback devices. 2 free loopback devices are required.  If run within a docker the loopback device must be mapped. Running 'make bash' from wigwag-build-env repo creates a Docker with the correct mapping.

# starting the upgrade process manually

Unpack the field upgrade tarball (usually called `field-upgradeupdate.tar.gz`) into the user partition, under `/upgrades`. 
Reboot the device after the unpacking is completed. The upgrade process will start upon detecting the required files.
